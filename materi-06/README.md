Kubernetes for Beginners


Based on a workshop originally written by J√©r√¥me Petazzoni with contributions from many others

Introduction
In this hands-on workshop, you will learn the basic concepts of Kubernetes. You will do that through interacting with Kubernetes through the command line terminals on the right. Ultimately you will deploy the sample applications Dockercoins on both worker nodes.

Getting Started
What are these terminals in the browsers?
On the right you should see two terminal windows. You may be asked to login first, which you can do either with a Docker ID or a GitHub account. Those terminals are fully functional terminals running Centos. Actually, they‚Äôre the commandline for Centos containers running on our Play-with-Kubernetes infrastructure. When you see code blocks that look like this, you can either click on them and they will auto populate, or your can copy and paste them.

  ls
Start the cluster
First step is to initialize the cluster in the first terminal:

  kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address $(hostname -i)
That will take a couple of minutes, during which time you‚Äôll see a lot of activity in the terminal.

You will see something like this at the end:

  Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

  To start using your cluster, you need to run (as a regular user):

    mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
    sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

  You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
  Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
    http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/addons/

  You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
  as root:

  kubeadm join --token SOMETOKEN SOMEIPADDRESS --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash SOMESHAHASH
Copy the whole line that starts kubeadm join from the first terminal and paste it into the second terminal. You should see something like this:

kubeadm join --token a146c9.9421a0d62a0611f4 172.26.0.2:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:9a4dc07bd8ac596336ecee6ce0928b3500174037c07a38a03bebef25e97c4db5
Initializing machine ID from random generator.
[kubeadm] WARNING: kubeadm is in beta, please do not use it for production clusters.

[bootstrap] The server supports the Certificates API (certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1)

Node join complete:
* Certificate signing request sent to master and response
  received.
* Kubelet informed of new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the master to see this machine join.
That means you‚Äôre almost ready to go. Last you just have to initialize your cluster networking in the first terminal:

   kubectl apply -n kube-system -f \
    "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 |tr -d '\n')"
You‚Äôll see an output like this:

  kubectl apply -n kube-system -f \
  >     "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 |tr -d '\n')"
  serviceaccount "weave-net" created
  clusterrole "weave-net" created
  clusterrolebinding "weave-net" created
  role "weave-net" created
  rolebinding "weave-net" created
  daemonset "weave-net" created
Your cluster is set up!

What‚Äôs this application?
It is a DockerCoin miner! üí∞üê≥üì¶üö¢

No, you can‚Äôt buy coffee with DockerCoins

How DockerCoins works:

worker asks to rng to generate a few random bytes

worker feeds these bytes into hasher

and repeat forever!

every second, worker updates redis to indicate how many loops were done

webui queries redis, and computes and exposes ‚Äúhashing speed‚Äù in your browser

Getting the application source code
We‚Äôve created a sample application to run for parts of the workshop. The application is in the dockercoins repository.

Let‚Äôs look at the general layout of the source code:

there is a Compose file docker-compose.yml ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ and 4 other services, each in its own directory:

rng = web service generating random bytes

hasher = web service computing hash of POSTed data

worker = background process using rng and hasher

webui = web interface to watch progress

We will clone the GitHub repository

The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use through the workshop

git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/dockercoins
(You can also fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork if you prefer that.)

Running the application
Go to the dockercoins directory, in the cloned repo:

cd ~/dockercoins
Use Compose to build and run all containers:

docker-compose up
Compose tells Docker to build all container images (pulling the corresponding base images), then starts all containers, and displays aggregated logs.

Lots of logs
The application continuously generates logs

We can see the worker service making requests to rng and hasher

Let‚Äôs put that in the background

Connecting to the web UI
The webui container exposes a web dashboard; let‚Äôs view it

With a web browser, connect to node1 here on port 8000 (created when you ran the application)

Clean up
Before moving on, let‚Äôs turn everything off by typing Ctrl-C.

Kubernetes concepts
Kubernetes is a container management system

It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

What does that really mean?

Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do
Start 5 containers using image atseashop/api:v1.3

Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

Start 10 containers using image atseashop/webfront:v1.3

Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

It‚Äôs Black Friday (or Christmas), traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

New release! Replace my containers with the new image atseashop/webfront:v1.4

Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

Other things that Kubernetes can do for us
Basic autoscaling

Blue/green deployment, canary deployment

Long running services, but also batch (one-off) jobs

Overcommit our cluster and evict low-priority jobs

Run services with stateful data (databases etc.)

Fine-grained access control defining what can be done by whom on which resources

Integrating third party services (service catalog)

Automating complex tasks (operators)

Kubernetes architecture
Kubernetes architecture: the master
The Kubernetes logic (its ‚Äúbrains‚Äù) is a collection of services:

the API server (our point of entry to everything!)
core services like the scheduler and controller manager
etcd (a highly available key/value store; the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù of Kubernetes)
*Together, these services form what is called the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù

These services can run straight on a host, or in containers (that‚Äôs an implementation detail)

etcd can be run on separate machines (first schema) or co-located (second schema)

We need at least one master, but we can have more (for high availability)

Kubernetes architecture: the nodes
The nodes executing our containers run another collection of services:

a container Engine (typically Docker)
kubelet (the ‚Äúnode agent‚Äù)
kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)
Nodes were formerly called ‚Äúminions‚Äù

It is customary to not run apps on the node(s) running master components (Except when using small development clusters)

Kubernetes resources
The Kubernetes API defines a lot of objects called resources

These resources are organized by type, or Kind (in the API)

A few common resource types are:

node (a machine ‚Äî physical or virtual ‚Äî in our cluster)
pod (group of containers running together on a node)
service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)
namespace (more-or-less isolated group of things)
secret (bundle of sensitive data to be passed to a container)
And much more! (We can see the full list by running kubectl get)

Declarative vs imperative
Our container orchestrator puts a very strong emphasis on being declarative

Declarative:

I would like a cup of tea.

Imperative:

Boil some water. Pour it in a teapot. Add tea leaves. Steep for a while. Serve in cup.

Declarative seems simpler at first ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ As long as you know how to brew tea

What declarative would really be:
I want a cup of tea, obtained by pouring an infusion of tea leaves in a cup.

An infusion is obtained by letting the object steep a few minutes in hot water.

Hot liquid is obtained by pouring it in an appropriate container and setting it on a stove.

Ah, finally, containers! Something we know about. Let‚Äôs get to work, shall we?

Summary of declarative vs imperative
Imperative systems:

simpler

if a task is interrupted, we have to restart from scratch

Declarative systems:

if a task is interrupted (or if we show up to the party half-way through), we can figure out what‚Äôs missing and do only what‚Äôs necessary

we need to be able to observe the system

‚Ä¶ and compute a ‚Äúdiff‚Äù between what we have and what we want

Declarative vs imperative in Kubernetes
Virtually everything we create in Kubernetes is created from a spec

Watch for the spec fields in the YAML files later!

The spec describes how we want the thing to be

Kubernetes will reconcile the current state with the spec (technically, this is done by a number of controllers)

When we want to change some resource, we update the spec

Kubernetes will then converge that resource

Kubernetes network model
TL,DR:

Our cluster (nodes and pods) is one big flat IP network.

In detail:

all nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

all pods must be able to reach each other, without NAT

pods and nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

each pod is aware of its IP address (no NAT)

Kubernetes doesn‚Äôt mandate any particular implementation

Kubernetes network model: the good
Everything can reach everything

No address translation

No port translation

No new protocol

Pods cannot move from a node to another and keep their IP address

IP addresses don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúportable‚Äù from a node to another (We can use e.g. a subnet per node and use a simple routed topology)

The specification is simple enough to allow many various implementations

Kubernetes network model: the less good
Everything can reach everything

if you want security, you need to add network policies

the network implementation that you use needs to support them

There are literally dozens of implementations out there (15 are listed in the Kubernetes documentation)

It looks like you have a level 3 network, but it‚Äôs only level 4 (The spec requires UDP and TCP, but not port ranges or arbitrary IP packets)

kube-proxy is on the data path when connecting to a pod or container, and it‚Äôs not particularly fast (relies on userland proxying or iptables)

Kubernetes network model: in practice
The nodes that we are using have been set up to use Weave

We don‚Äôt endorse Weave in a particular way, it just Works For Us

Don‚Äôt worry about the warning about kube-proxy performance

Unless you:

routinely saturate 10G network interfaces

count packet rates in millions per second

run high-traffic VOIP or gaming platforms

do weird things that involve millions of simultaneous connections (in which case you‚Äôre already familiar with kernel tuning)

First contact with kubectl
kubectl is (almost) the only tool we‚Äôll need to talk to Kubernetes

It is a rich CLI tool around the Kubernetes API (Everything you can do with kubectl, you can do directly with the API)

You can also use the --kubeconfig flag to pass a config file

Or directly --server, --user, etc.

kubectl can be pronounced ‚ÄúCube C T L‚Äù, ‚ÄúCube cuttle‚Äù, ‚ÄúCube cuddle‚Äù‚Ä¶

kubectl get
Let‚Äôs look at our Node resources with kubectl get!

Look at the composition of our cluster:

kubectl get node
These commands are equivalent

kubectl get no
kubectl get node
kubectl get nodes
Obtaining machine-readable output
kubectl get can output JSON, YAML, or be directly formatted

Give us more info about the nodes:

kubectl get nodes -o wide
Let‚Äôs have some YAML:

kubectl get no -o yaml
See that kind: List at the end? It‚Äôs the type of our result!

(Ab)using kubectl and jq
It‚Äôs super easy to build custom reports

Show the capacity of all our nodes as a stream of JSON objects:

kubectl get nodes -o json |
      jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
What‚Äôs available?
kubectl has pretty good introspection facilities

We can list all available resource types by running kubectl get

We can view details about a resource with:
kubectl describe type/name
kubectl describe type name
We can view the definition for a resource type with:
kubectl explain type
Each time, type can be singular, plural, or abbreviated type name.

Services
A service is a stable endpoint to connect to ‚Äúsomething‚Äù (In the initial proposal, they were called ‚Äúportals‚Äù)

List the services on our cluster:

kubectl get services
This would also work:

    kubectl get svc
There is already one service on our cluster: the Kubernetes API itself.

ClusterIP services
A ClusterIP service is internal, available from the cluster only

This is useful for introspection from within containers

Try to connect to the API.

-k is used to skip certificate verification
Make sure to replace 10.96.0.1 with the CLUSTER-IP shown by $ kubectl get svc
curl -k https://10.96.0.1
The error that we see is expected: the Kubernetes API requires authentication.

Listing running containers
Containers are manipulated through pods

A pod is a group of containers:

running together (on the same node)

sharing resources (RAM, CPU; but also network, volumes)

List pods on our cluster:

kubectl get pods
These are not the pods you‚Äôre looking for. But where are they?!?

Namespaces
Namespaces allow us to segregate resources

List the namespaces on our cluster with one of these commands:

kubectl get namespaces
either of these would work as well:

kubectl get namespace
kubectl get ns
You know what ‚Ä¶ This kube-system thing looks suspicious.

Accessing namespaces
By default, kubectl uses the default namespace

We can switch to a different namespace with the -n option

List the pods in the kube-system namespace:

kubectl -n kube-system get pods
Ding ding ding ding ding!

What are all these pods?
etcd is our etcd server

kube-apiserver is the API server

kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler are other master components

kube-dns is an additional component (not mandatory but super useful, so it‚Äôs there)

kube-proxy is the (per-node) component managing port mappings and such

weave is the (per-node) component managing the network overlay
the READY column indicates the number of containers in each pod

the pods with a name ending with -node1 are the master components (they have been specifically ‚Äúpinned‚Äù to the master node)

Running our first containers on Kubernetes
First things first: we cannot run a container

We are going to run a pod, and in that pod there will be a single container

In that container in the pod, we are going to run a simple ping command

Then we are going to start additional copies of the pod

Starting a simple pod with kubectl run
We need to specify at least a name and the image we want to use

Let‚Äôs ping 8.8.8.8, Google‚Äôs public DNS

kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 8.8.8.8
OK, what just happened?

Behind the scenes of kubectl run
Let‚Äôs look at the resources that were created by kubectl run

List most resource types:

kubectl get all
We should see the following things:

deploy/pingpong (the deployment that we just created)
rs/pingpong-xxxx (a replica set created by the deployment)
po/pingpong-yyyy (a pod created by the replica set)
What are these different things?
A deployment is a high-level construct

allows scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks

multiple deployments can be used together to implement a canary deployment

delegates pods management to replica sets

A replica set is a low-level construct

makes sure that a given number of identical pods are running

allows scaling

rarely used directly

A replication controller is the (deprecated) predecessor of a replica set

Our pingpong deployment
kubectl run created a deployment, deploy/pingpong

That deployment created a replica set, rs/pingpong-xxxx

That replica set created a pod, po/pingpong-yyyy

We‚Äôll see later how these folks play together for:

scaling

high availability

rolling updates

Viewing container output
Let‚Äôs use the kubectl logs command

We will pass either a pod name, or a type/name (E.g. if we specify a deployment or replica set, it will get the first pod in it)

Unless specified otherwise, it will only show logs of the first container in the pod (Good thing there‚Äôs only one in ours!)

View the result of our ping command:

kubectl logs deploy/pingpong
Streaming logs in real time
Just like docker logs, kubectl logs supports convenient options:

-f/--follow to stream logs in real time (√† la tail -f)

--tail to indicate how many lines you want to see (from the end)

--since to get logs only after a given timestamp

View the latest logs of our ping command:

kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 1 --follow
Scaling our application
We can create additional copies of our container (or rather our pod) with kubectl scale

Scale our pingpong deployment:

kubectl scale deploy/pingpong --replicas 8
Note: what if we tried to scale rs/pingpong-xxxx? We could! But the deployment would notice it right away, and scale back to the initial level.

Resilience
The deployment pingpong watches its replica set

The replica set ensures that the right number of pods are running

What happens if pods disappear?

In a separate window, list pods, and keep watching them:
kubectl get pods -w
Ctrl-C to terminate watching.

If you wanted to destroy a pod, you would use this pattern where yyyy was the identifier of the particular pod:
kubectl delete pod pingpong-yyyy
What if we wanted something different?
What if we wanted to start a ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù container that doesn‚Äôt get restarted?

We could use kubectl run --restart=OnFailure or kubectl run --restart=Never

These commands would create jobs or pods instead of deployments

Under the hood, kubectl run invokes ‚Äúgenerators‚Äù to create resource descriptions

We could also write these resource descriptions ourselves (typically in YAML), and create them on the cluster with kubectl apply -f (discussed later)

With kubectl run --schedule=‚Ä¶, we can also create cronjobs

Viewing logs of multiple pods
When we specify a deployment name, only one single pod‚Äôs logs are shown

We can view the logs of multiple pods by specifying a selector

A selector is a logic expression using labels

Conveniently, when you kubectl run somename, the associated objects have a run=somename label

View the last line of log from all pods with the run=pingpong label:

kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1
Unfortunately, --follow cannot (yet) be used to stream the logs from multiple containers.

Clean-up
Clean up your deployment by deleting pingpong

kubectl delete deploy/pingpong
Exposing containers
kubectl expose creates a service for existing pods

A service is a stable address for a pod (or a bunch of pods)

If we want to connect to our pod(s), we need to create a service

Once a service is created, kube-dns will allow us to resolve it by name (i.e. after creating service hello, the name hello will resolve to something)

There are different types of services, detailed on the following slides:

ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName

Basic service types
ClusterIP (default type)

a virtual IP address is allocated for the service (in an internal, private range) this IP address is reachable only from within the cluster (nodes and pods) our code can connect to the service using the original port number

NodePort

a port is allocated for the service (by default, in the 30000-32768 range) that port is made available on all our nodes and anybody can connect to it our code must be changed to connect to that new port number

These service types are always available.

Under the hood: kube-proxy is using a userland proxy and a bunch of iptables rules.

More service types
LoadBalancer
an external load balancer is allocated for the service
the load balancer is configured accordingly (e.g.: a NodePort service is created, and the load balancer sends traffic to that port)
ExternalName

the DNS entry managed by kube-dns will just be a CNAME to a provided record
no port, no IP address, no nothing else is allocated
Running containers with open ports
Since ping doesn‚Äôt have anything to connect to, we‚Äôll have to run something else

Start a bunch of ElasticSearch containers:
kubectl run elastic --image=elasticsearch:2 --replicas=4
Watch them being started:

kubectl get pods -w
The -w option ‚Äúwatches‚Äù events happening on the specified resources.

Note: please DO NOT call the service search. It would collide with the TLD.

Exposing our deployment
We‚Äôll create a default ClusterIP service

Expose the ElasticSearch HTTP API port:

kubectl expose deploy/elastic --port 9200
Look up which IP address was allocated:

kubectl get svc
Services are layer 4 constructs
You can assign IP addresses to services, but they are still layer 4 (i.e. a service is not an IP address; it‚Äôs an IP address + protocol + port)

This is caused by the current implementation of kube-proxy (it relies on mechanisms that don‚Äôt support layer 3)

As a result: you have to indicate the port number for your service

Running services with arbitrary port (or port ranges) requires hacks (e.g. host networking mode)

Testing our service
We will now send a few HTTP requests to our ElasticSearch pods

Let‚Äôs obtain the IP address that was allocated for our service, programatically:

IP=$(kubectl get svc elastic -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP }}')
Send a few requests:

curl http://$IP:9200/
Our requests are load balanced across multiple pods.

Clean up
We‚Äôre done with the elastic deployment, so let‚Äôs clean it up

kubectl delete deploy/elastic
Our app on Kube
What‚Äôs on the menu?
In this part, we will:

build images for our app,

ship these images with a registry,

run deployments using these images,

expose these deployments so they can communicate with each other,

expose the web UI so we can access it from outside.

The plan
Build on our control node (node1)

Tag images so that they are named $USERNAME/servicename

Upload them to a Docker Hub

Create deployments using the images

Expose (with a ClusterIP) the services that need to communicate

Expose (with a NodePort) the WebUI

Setup
In the first terminal, set an environment variable for your Docker Hub user name. It can be the same Docker Hub user name that you used to log in to the terminals on this site.

export USERNAME=YourUserName
Make sure you‚Äôre still in the dockercoins directory.

pwd
A note on registries
For this workshop, we‚Äôll use Docker Hub. There are a number of other options, including two provided by Docker.

Docker also provides:

Docker Trusted Registry which adds in a lot of security and deployment features including security scanning, and role-based access control.
Docker Open Source Registry.
Docker Hub
Docker Hub is the default registry for Docker.

Image names on Hub are just $USERNAME/$IMAGENAME or $ORGANIZATIONNAME/$IMAGENAME.

Official images can be referred to as just $IMAGENAME.

To use Hub, make sure you have an account. Then type docker login in the terminal and login with your username and password.

Using Docker Trusted Registry, Docker Open Source Registry is very similar.

Image names on other registries are $REGISTRYPATH/$USERNAME/$IMAGENAME or $REGISTRYPATH/$ORGANIZATIONNAME/$IMAGENAME.

Login using docker login $REGISTRYPATH.

Building and pushing our images
We are going to use a convenient feature of Docker Compose

Go to the stacks directory:

cd ~/dockercoins/stacks
Build and push the images:

docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
Let‚Äôs have a look at the dockercoins.yml file while this is building and pushing.

version: "3"
services:
  rng:
    build: dockercoins/rng
    image: ${USERNAME}/rng:${TAG-latest}
    deploy:
      mode: global
  ...
  redis:
    image: redis
  ...
  worker:
    build: dockercoins/worker
    image: ${USERNAME}/worker:${TAG-latest}
    ...
    deploy:
      replicas: 10
Just in case you were wondering ‚Ä¶ Docker ‚Äúservices‚Äù are not Kubernetes ‚Äúservices‚Äù.

Deploying all the things
We can now deploy our code (as well as a redis instance)

Deploy redis:

kubectl run redis --image=redis
Deploy everything else:

for SERVICE in hasher rng webui worker; do
  kubectl run $SERVICE --image=$USERNAME/$SERVICE -l app=$SERVICE
done
Is this working?
After waiting for the deployment to complete, let‚Äôs look at the logs!

(Hint: use kubectl get deploy -w to watch deployment events)

Look at some logs:

kubectl logs deploy/rng
kubectl logs deploy/worker
ü§î rng is fine ‚Ä¶ But not worker.

üí° Oh right! We forgot to expose.

Exposing services
Exposing services internally
Three deployments need to be reachable by others: hasher, redis, rng

worker doesn‚Äôt need to be exposed

webui will be dealt with later

Expose each deployment, specifying the right port:

kubectl expose deployment redis --port 6379
kubectl expose deployment rng --port 80
kubectl expose deployment hasher --port 80
Is this working yet?
The worker has an infinite loop, that retries 10 seconds after an error

Stream the worker‚Äôs logs:

kubectl logs deploy/worker --follow
(Give it about 10 seconds to recover)

We should now see the worker, well, working happily.
Exposing services for external access
Now we would like to access the Web UI

We will expose it with a NodePort (just like we did for the registry)

Create a NodePort service for the Web UI:

kubectl create service nodeport webui --tcp=80 --node-port=30001
Check the port that was allocated:

kubectl get svc
Accessing the web UI
We can now connect to any node, on the allocated node port, to view the web UI
Click on this link

Alright, we‚Äôre back to where we started, when we were running on a single node!

Security implications of kubectl apply
When we do kubectl apply -f <URL>, we create arbitrary resources

Resources can be evil; imagine a deployment that ‚Ä¶

starts bitcoin miners on the whole cluster

hides in a non-default namespace

bind-mounts our nodes‚Äô filesystem

inserts SSH keys in the root account (on the node)

encrypts our data and ransoms it

‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

kubectl apply is the new curl | sh
curl | sh is convenient

It‚Äôs safe if you use HTTPS URLs from trusted sources

kubectl apply -f is convenient

It‚Äôs safe if you use HTTPS URLs from trusted sources

It introduces new failure modes

Example: the official setup instructions for most pod networks

Scaling a deployment
We will start with an easy one: the worker deployment

kubectl get pods

kubectl get deployments
Now, create more worker replicas:

kubectl scale deploy/worker --replicas=10
After a few seconds, the graph in the web UI should show up. (And peak at 10 hashes/second, just like when we were running on a single one.)

Daemon sets
What if we want one (and exactly one) instance of rng per node?

If we just scale deploy/rng to 2, nothing guarantees that they spread

Instead of a deployment, we will use a daemonset

Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:

kube-proxy
weave (our overlay network)
monitoring agents
hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)
etc.
They can also be restricted to run only on some nodes.

Creating a daemon set
Unfortunately, as of Kubernetes 1.9, the CLI cannot create daemon sets

More precisely: it doesn‚Äôt have a subcommand to create a daemon set

But any kind of resource can always be created by providing a YAML description:

kubectl apply -f foo.yaml
How do we create the YAML file for our daemon set?

option 1: read the docs
option 2: vi our way out of it
Creating the YAML file for our daemon set
Let‚Äôs start with the YAML file for the current rng resource

Dump the rng resource in YAML:

kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml --export >rng.yml
Edit rng.yml

Note: --export will remove ‚Äúcluster-specific‚Äù information, i.e.:

namespace (so that the resource is not tied to a specific namespace) status and creation timestamp (useless when creating a new resource) resourceVersion and uid (these would cause‚Ä¶ interesting problems)

‚ÄúCasting‚Äù a resource to another
What if we just changed the kind field?

(It can‚Äôt be that easy, right?)

Change kind: Deployment to kind: DaemonSet

Save, quit

Try to create our new resource:

  kubectl apply -f rng.yml
We all knew this couldn‚Äôt be that easy, right!
Understanding the problem
The core of the error is:

error validating data:
[ValidationError(DaemonSet.spec):
unknown field "replicas" in io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DaemonSetSpec,
...
Obviously, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to specify a number of replicas for a daemon set

Workaround: fix the YAML

remove the replicas field
remove the strategy field (which defines the rollout mechanism for a deployment)
remove the status: {} line at the end
Or, we could also ‚Ä¶

Use the --force, Luke
We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

The --force flag actual name is --validate=false

Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors:

kubectl apply -f rng.yml --validate=false
Use the ‚Äìforce, Luke We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

The ‚Äìforce flag actual name is ‚Äìvalidate=false

Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors: kubectl apply -f rng.yml ‚Äìvalidate=false üé©‚ú®üêá

Wait ‚Ä¶ Now, can it be that easy?

Checking what we‚Äôve done
Did we transform our deployment into a daemonset?

Look at the resources that we have now:

kubectl get all
We have both deploy/rng and ds/rng now!

And one too many pods‚Ä¶

Explanation
You can have different resource types with the same name (i.e. a deployment and a daemonset both named rng)

We still have the old rng deployment

But now we have the new rng daemonset as well

If we look at the pods, we have:

one pod for the deployment
one pod per node for the daemonset
What are all these pods doing?
Let‚Äôs check the logs of all these rng pods

All these pods have a run=rng label:

the first pod, because that‚Äôs what kubectl run does
the other ones (in the daemon set), because we copied the spec from the first one
Therefore, we can query everybody‚Äôs logs using that run=rng selector

Check the logs of all the pods having a label run=rng:

kubectl logs -l run=rng --tail 1
It appears that all the pods are serving requests at the moment.

Removing the first pod from the load balancer
What would happen if we removed that pod, with kubectl delete pod ...?

The replicaset would re-create it immediately.

What would happen if we removed the run=rng label from that pod?

The replicaset would re-create it immediately.

‚Ä¶ Because what matters to the replicaset is the number of pods matching that selector.

But but but ‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt we have more than one pod with run=rng now?

The answer lies in the exact selector used by the replicaset ‚Ä¶

Deep dive into selectors
Let‚Äôs look at the selectors for the rng deployment and the associated replica set

Show detailed information about the rng deployment:

kubectl describe deploy rng
Show detailed information about the rng replica:

kubectl describe rs rng-yyyy
The replica set selector also has a pod-template-hash, unlike the pods in our daemon set.

Updating a service through labels and selectors
What if we want to drop the rng deployment from the load balancer?

Option 1:

destroy it
Option 2:

add an extra label to the daemon set
update the service selector to refer to that label
Of course, option 2 offers more learning opportunities. Right?

Add an extra label to the daemon set
We will update the daemon set ‚Äúspec‚Äù

Option 1:

edit the rng.yml file that we used earlier
load the new definition with kubectl apply
Option 2:

use kubectl edit
If you feel like you got this, feel free to try directly. We‚Äôve included a few hints on the next slides for your convenience!

We‚Äôve put resources in your resources
Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources!

There is a difference between:

the label(s) of a resource (in the metadata block in the beginning)
the selector of a resource (in the spec block)
the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the template block)
You need to update the selector and the template (metadata labels are not mandatory)

The template must match the selector (i.e. the resource will refuse to create resources that it will not select)

Adding our label
Let‚Äôs add a label isactive: yes

In YAML, yes should be quoted; i.e. isactive: "yes"

Update the daemon set to add isactive: "yes" to the selector and template label:

kubectl edit daemonset rng
spec:
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rng      
      isactive: "yes"
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: rng      
        isactive: "yes"
Update the service to add isactive: "yes" to its selector:

kubectl edit service rng
Checking what we‚Äôve done
Check the logs of all run=rng pods to confirm that only 2 of them are now active:

kubectl logs -l run=rng
The timestamps should give us a hint about how many pods are currently receiving traffic.

Look at the pods that we have right now:

kubectl get pods
More labels, more selectors, more problems?
Bonus exercise 1: clean up the pods of the ‚Äúold‚Äù daemon set

Bonus exercise 2: how could we have done this to avoid creating new pods?

Rolling updates
By default (without rolling updates), when a scaled resource is updated:

new pods are created
old pods are terminated
‚Ä¶ all at the same time
if something goes wrong, ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
With rolling updates, when a resource is updated, it happens progressively

Two parameters determine the pace of the rollout: maxUnavailable and maxSurge

They can be specified in absolute number of pods, or percentage of the replicas count

At any given time ‚Ä¶

there will always be at least replicas-maxUnavailable pods available
there will never be more than replicas+maxSurge pods in total
there will therefore be up to maxUnavailable+maxSurge pods being updated
We have the possibility to rollback to the previous version (if the update fails or is unsatisfactory in any way)

Rolling updates in practice
As of Kubernetes 1.8, we can do rolling updates with:

deployments, daemonsets, statefulsets

Editing one of these resources will automatically result in a rolling update

Rolling updates can be monitored with the kubectl rollout subcommand

Building a new version of the worker service
Edit dockercoins/worker/worker.py, update the sleep line to sleep 1 second

Go to the stack directory:

cd stacks
Build a new tag and push it to the registry:

  export TAG=v0.2
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
Rolling out the new worker service
Let‚Äôs monitor what‚Äôs going on by opening a few terminals, and run:

  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get replicasets -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
Update worker either with kubectl edit, or by running:

kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$USERNAME/worker:$TAG
That rollout should be pretty quick. What shows in the web UI?

Rolling out an error
What happens if we make a mistake?

Update worker by specifying a non-existent image:

export TAG=v0.3
kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
Check what‚Äôs going on:

kubectl rollout status deploy worker
Our rollout is stuck. However, the app is not dead (just 10% slower).

Recovering from a bad rollout
We could push some v0.3 image (the pod retry logic will eventually catch it and the rollout will proceed)

Or we could invoke a manual rollback

Cancel the deployment and wait for the dust to settle down:

kubectl rollout undo deploy worker
kubectl rollout status deploy worker
Changing rollout parameters
We want to:

revert to v0.1 (which we now realize we didn‚Äôt tag - yikes!)
be conservative on availability (always have desired number of available workers)
be aggressive on rollout speed (update more than one pod at a time)
give some time to our workers to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù before starting more
The corresponding changes can be expressed in the following YAML snippet:

spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: $USERNAME/worker:latest
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 3
  minReadySeconds: 10
Applying changes through a YAML patch
We could use kubectl edit deployment worker

But we could also use kubectl patch with the exact YAML shown before

Apply all our changes and wait for them to take effect:

kubectl patch deployment worker -p "
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: $USERNAME/worker:latest
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 3
  minReadySeconds: 10
"
kubectl rollout status deployment worker
Next steps
Alright, how do I get started and containerize my apps?

Suggested containerization checklist:

write a Dockerfile for one service in one app
write Dockerfiles for the other (buildable) services
write a Compose file for that whole app
make sure that devs are empowered to run the app in containers
set up automated builds of container images from the code repo
set up a CI pipeline using these container images
set up a CD pipeline (for staging/QA) using these images
And then it is time to look at orchestration!

Namespaces
Namespaces let you run multiple identical stacks side by side

Two namespaces (e.g. blue and green) can each have their own redis service

Each of the two redis services has its own ClusterIP

kube-dns creates two entries, mapping to these two ClusterIP addresses:

redis.blue.svc.cluster.local and redis.green.svc.cluster.local

Pods in the blue namespace get a search suffix of blue.svc.cluster.local

As a result, resolving redis from a pod in the blue namespace yields the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù redis

This does not provide isolation! That would be the job of network policies.

Stateful services (databases etc.)
As a first step, it is wiser to keep stateful services outside of the cluster

Exposing them to pods can be done with multiple solutions:

ExternalName services (redis.blue.svc.cluster.local will be a CNAME record)

ClusterIP services with explicit Endpoints (instead of letting Kubernetes generate the endpoints from a selector)

Ambassador services (application-level proxies that can provide credentials injection and more)

Stateful services (second take)
If you really want to host stateful services on Kubernetes, you can look into:

volumes (to carry persistent data)
storage plugins
persistent volume claims (to ask for specific volume characteristics)
stateful sets (pods that are not ephemeral)
HTTP traffic handling
Services are layer 4 constructs

HTTP is a layer 7 protocol

It is handled by ingresses (a different resource kind)

Ingresses allow:

virtual host routing
session stickiness
URI mapping
and much more!
Logging and metrics
Logging is delegated to the container engine

Metrics are typically handled with Prometheus

Managing the configuration of our applications
Two constructs are particularly useful: secrets and config maps

They allow to expose arbitrary information to our containers

Avoid storing configuration in container images (There are some exceptions to that rule, but it‚Äôs generally a Bad Idea)

Never store sensitive information in container images (It‚Äôs the container equivalent of the password on a post-it note on your screen)

Cluster federation
Kubernetes master operation relies on etcd

etcd uses the Raft protocol

Raft recommends low latency between nodes

What if our cluster spreads to multiple regions?

Break it down in local clusters

Regroup them in a cluster federation

Synchronize resources across clusters

Discover resources across clusters

Developer experience
I‚Äôve put this last, but it‚Äôs pretty important!

How do you on-board a new developer?

What do they need to install to get a dev stack?
How does a code change make it from dev to prod?
How does someone add a component to a stack?
